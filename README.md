# Sample Projects

These are projects provided as fully working examples, as companion to articles from my blog:

- [kotlin-db-migrations](./kotlin-db-migrations) â€” as described in the article [Database Migrations with Kotlin](https://alexn.org/blog/2023/05/02/managing-database-migrations-kotlin/);

The repository isn't actively monitored or updated, don't rely on this code to be up-to-date.
